# lGui (don't ask about the name)

## Credits

This code is entirely from https://github.com/noteffex. This is a structure re-work to make it easier to edit & mantain.

## How to use

Just add new ImGui draw calls in Gui::Init. You'll see '// DRAW_START', inside of them curly braces just add new things to the menu.
